# Simple Linear Regression

Author: YBI FOUNDATION

Mentee assignment from IBM Advance AI @ Infinite Learning Course completion of Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Document Using LLM from CognitiveClass.ai

## Overview

Welcome to the "Simple Linear Regression" repository! This project is a mentee assignment from the IBM Advance AI program, following the completion of the "Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Document Using LLM" course from CognitiveClass.ai. In this project, we explore the concept of simple linear regression, a fundamental technique in statistical modeling and machine learning. Simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable.

### Key Features

- **Simple Linear Regression Implementation**: Learn how to implement simple linear regression using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Explore the statistical concepts behind simple linear regression and its application in predictive modeling.

- **Data Visualization**: Utilize data visualization libraries to visualize the relationship between variables and interpret regression results.
